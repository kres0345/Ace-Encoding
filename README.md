Needs cool acronym. A enciphering languages witch has an expansion ratio of 2:1.

Calculations:
Chars available: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 1234567890 ! @ # % & / \ < > { } ( ) = " ' + - * [ ] $ | ? - _ ` that's 89 characters(incl. space). That's a lot.

So to make the ratio 2:1 we have to make 1 char represent 1 or 2 characters at once. That means we'll need:
`(89 * 89) + 89`, So many unique characters are we gonna need. Damn. That's 8010 Chars.

This project is still being developed and calculated, it's a pretty tough calculas and is thus put on the shelf for now
